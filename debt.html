    <h1>1. Mind yo’ own business</h1>
    

    <p>Being in debt can be overwhelming and it can be hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel if you have mounting bills to pay, especially during the cost-of-living challenges.</p> 
    </p>Richard Branson said it best, our first top tip is to ‘mind your own business’ and prioritise!</p>

    
    <p>When thinking about and trying to get out of debt, make sure to focus on the most important things first.</p>
    <p>Some great questions to ask yourself are do I have a debt consolidation action plan and do I understand my financial affairs?</p>

    <h1>2. Mind the electoral gap</h1>
    
    
    <p>Did you know that having your name on the electoral roll is usually seen as a sign of stability and dependability – and helps a finance firm confirm your identity and improve your credit rating.<p>
    
    
    </p>If you’re currently a sofa surfer, you may have also dropped off the register. Can you reach out to friends and family to see if they can support you in getting added back on within their local authority?</p>

    </p>You can also apply any time on the Government website; you’ll need your National Insurance number and local authority name to register. Don’t fall through the electoral gap!</p>
